    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information about your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or specific computational tricks, etc.), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",

    "### <font color=\"ce33ff\">DESCRIPTION</font>:\n",
    "This notebook allows you for a binary classification (two classes only). You will classify movie reviews into \"positive\" reviews and \"negative\" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **IMDB** dataset is a set of 50.000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They are split into 25.000 reviews for training and 25.000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.\n",
    "The IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has already been preprocessed: the reviews (sequences of words) \n",
    "have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary.\n",

    "If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n",
    "Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n",
    "This should be done using markdown.<br> \n",
    "<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook before submitting it.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n",
    "1. import the notebook into Google Colab.\n",
    "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date.\n",
    "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
    "3. read the entire notebook carefully.\n",
    "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
    "    * run the notebook for the first time and note the result in your markdown result table (your test plan). \n",
    "4. go into the section 'building the ANN'.\n",
    "    * add the missing code that does create a network as shown in the image in the lecture slides on page 166 (File: 'DIS21a.1-7.HANDS_ON.First.DLNetwork.Architectures.for.Solving.Three.Interesting.Problems.pdf')\n",
    "    * set the activation function to ReLu\n",
    "    * set the correct activation function in the last layer (the output layer). What is correct?\n",
    "5. stay in the 'building the ANN' section again.\n",
    "    * add the missing code for compiling the network by setting\n",
    "        * the loss function\n",
    "        * the optimizer\n",
    "        * the evaluation metric (little hint: is the label distribution balanced ?)\n",
    "6. take less `training` data and rerun the network.\n",
    "    * add the size of the training data as a column in the table and note the accuracy you achieve\n",
    "7. take less `testing` data and rerun the network.\n",
    "    * add the size of the testing data as a column in the table and note the accuracy you achieve\n",
    "8. increase/decrease the number of epochs and the batch size \n",
    "    * add those hyperparameters as columns in the table and note the accuracy you achieve\n",
    "9. make combinations of this according to your testplan. Make sure you combine with sense and reason and not just chaotically.\n",
    "10. comment your observations.\n",
    "    * when is the accuracy increasing / decreasing\n",
    "11. until now there were 2 hidden layers. Try to use 1 or 3 hidden layers and see how it affects the test accuracy. Use again a little table. Describe your observations.\n",
    "12. Try to use layers with more hidden units or less hidden units: 32 units, 64 units, 128 units ...! What effect can you observe?\n",
    "13. Try to use the `mse` loss function instead of `binary_crossentropy`. What effect can you observe?\n",
    "14. Try to use the `tanh` activation (an activation that was popular in the early days of neural networks) instead of `relu`. What effect can you observe?"
