    "**GENERAL NOTE 1**: \n",
    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information about your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or specific computational tricks, etc.), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",
    "* When describing an observation (for instance, after you have run through your test plan) you may use German language.\n",
    "This applies to all exercises in DIS 21a.1.  \n",

    "### <font color=\"ce33ff\">DESCRIPTION</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows for learning how you effectively fight overfitting when using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with small data sets. Training an image classification model using only very little data is a very common situation whenever working in computer vision within a professional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible to train a CNN to solve a complex problem with just a few tens of samples, but a few hundreds can \n",
    "potentially suffice if the model is small and well-regularized and if the task is simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because CNNs learn local, translation-invariant features, they are very data-efficient on perceptual problems. \n",
    "Training a CNN from scratch on a very small image dataset will still yield reasonable results despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any custom feature engineering. You will see this in action in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise focuses on classifying images as \"dogs\" or \"cats\", in a dataset containing 4000 pictures of cats and dogs (2000 cats, 2000 dogs). 2000 pictures are used for training, 1000 for validation, and finally 1000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the start, a small CNN is going to be trained on 2000 training samples, without any regularization for getting a performance baseline (classification accuracy). It will become obvious quite quickly that the main issue is overfitting. \n",
    "Then, *data augmentation* is going to be used, as you have learned it to be a powerful technique for fighting overfitting in computer vision.\n",
    "\n",

    "However, since this exercise is dealing with bigger images and a more complex problem, the CNN architecture should be made accordingly larger and should have one more `Conv2D` + `MaxPooling2D` stage. This serves both, to augment the capacity of the network and to further reduce the size of the feature maps, so that they are not by far to large when the `Flatten` layer is reached. Here, since the starting image size is 150x150 (an arbitrary choice btw), the feature maps can end with a size of 7x7 right before the `Flatten` layer.\n",
