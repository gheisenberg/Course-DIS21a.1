    "**GENERAL NOTE 1**: \n",
    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information about your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or specific computational tricks, etc.), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",
    "* When describing an observation (for instance, after you have run through your test plan) you may use German language.\n",
    "This applies to all exercises in DIS 21a.1.  \n",

    "### <font color=\"ce33ff\">DESCRIPTION</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you for learning how you effectively setup and use convolutional neural networks (CNN). \n",
    "For this purpose, the classification of the MNIST digits from the earlier exercise is done again. \n",
    "Using a densely (fully) connected ANN in that previous exercise, you have achieved a test accuracy of about 97%. \n",
    "Even though the CNN will be very basic, its accuracy will blow out that of a densely-connected ANN.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows in a few lines of code what a basic CNN looks alike. \n",
    "Basically, it is a simple stack of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=\"FFC300\">TASKS</font>:\n",
    "Within this notebook, the tasks that you need to work on are always listed as bullet points below. \n",
    "If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n",
    "Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n",
    "This should be done using markdown.<br> \n",
    "<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook before submitting it.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n",
    "1. import the notebook to Google Colab.\n",
    "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date. \n",
    "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
    "3. read the entire notebook carefully. \n",
    "    * for better understanding, add comments whereever you feel it necessary.\n",
    "    * run the notebook for the first time and note the result in a markdown table. \n",
    "        * I have provided you with an example of a table in markdown (see below). Make sure you adapt your table accordingly. \n",
    "        * Put the table at the end of the notebook. \n",
    "        * This type of table will be needed in the other exercises as well. Always put it at the end.\n",

    "4. write the code for 'loading and preparing the MNIST data set'.\n",
    "5. write the code for 'training the CNN'.\n",
    "    * epochs=5\n",
    "    * batch_size=64 \n",
    "6. write the code for 'evaluating the CNN', initially with the given hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Compare the obtained result to the one you obtained by the densely connected ANN and compute the increase of accuracy in percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. write a test plan for testing other hyperparameters. Store the values (also the one from task 7) in a table as the one from above. \n",
