    "**GENERAL NOTE 1**: \n",
    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information about your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or specific computational tricks, etc.), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",
    "* When describing an observation (for instance, after you have run through your test plan) you may use German language.\n",

    "4. at the end of PART II, interprete the two charts (training and validation accuracy) and (training and validation loss) and describe your findings.\n",
    "5. the exercise in this notebook contains in PART III one single implementational task. \n",
    "    * implement a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by yourself using Keras' built-in functions.\n",
