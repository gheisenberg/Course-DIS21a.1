    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",

    "\n",
    "Until now, in all the examples  (movie review sentiment prediction, topic classification, and house price regression) \n",
    "we noticed that the model performance on the simple hold-out validation data always peaked after a few epochs and then started degrading, i.e. the model quickly started to _overfit_ to the training data. Overfitting happens in every single machine learning problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning and becoming a good data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you for learning how you effectively can fight overfitting by preventing a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data. As you have learned in my lecture already, the best solution is of course to get more training data. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is not possible, the next best solution is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of fighting overfitting this way is called _regularization_. Let us review some of the most common regularization techniques and apply them in practice. For doing so, the IMDB movie classification model from the previous exercise is chosen again.\n",

    "        * I have provided you with an example of a table in markdown (see below). Make sure you adapt your table accordingly. \n",

    "    * visualize all their performance curves in the same two charts: the one for the acc and the one for the loss.\n",
    "    * (`little hint`: since the batch_size and the no_of_epochs stays the same always, you should consider to build yourself a (ANN_build_compile_function) which you can instantiate everytime you want to build a new ANN of different size. Store the history object in a list and visualize them as indicated above.\n",
    "    * use a table similar to the one from above to store the min_no_of_epochs for every model. You might consider to call a python function to compute the minimum rather than doing it visually.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. write a test plan for testing the so-called dropout regularization. Start with dropout of 10% and then increase stepwise to end up with 90% and see what happens to the ANN. Store the values in the table (as the one from above) and try find the best dropout-rate.\n",

    "#### 1. Reducing the network's size\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"C70039\">Always keep this in mind:</font> <font color=\"ce33ff\">machine learning, and especially deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets, in other words, the type of representations that we data scientists are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"C70039\">NOTE:</font><font color=\"ce33ff\">Always keep in mind that you should be using models that have enough parameters that they will not be underfitting: your model should not be starved for memorization resources. </font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<font color=\"C70039\">There is a compromise to be found between `too much capacity` and `not enough capacity`.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is or what the right size for each layer is. A data scientist needs to evaluate an array of different architectures in order to find the right model size. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters and start increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until diminishing returns with regard to the validation loss. \n",

    "\n",
    "According to Occam's Razor, given some training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple _models_) that could explain the data, and simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `simple model` in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has got less entropy or a model with fewer parameters altogether, as seen in the first section above. Thus, a common way to fight overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a kind of _cost_ associated with having large weights. In the lecture you have learned two ways of regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _absolute value of the weight coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the \"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n",

L2 regularization is also called _weight decay_ in the context of neural networks. As often in machine learning, do not let the different names confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n",
