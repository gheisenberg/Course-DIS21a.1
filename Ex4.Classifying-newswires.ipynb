    "**GENERAL NOTE 1**: \n",
    "Please make sure you are reading the entire notebook, since it contains a lot of information about your tasks (e.g. regarding the set of certain paramaters or specific computational tricks, etc.), and the written mark downs as well as comments contain a lot of information on how things work together as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",
    "* When describing an observation (for instance, after you have run through your test plan) you may use German language.\n",
    "This applies to all exercises in DIS 21a.1.  \n",

    "### <font color=\"ce33ff\">DESCRIPTION</font>:\n",
    "The previous exercises were dealing with classification problems, that was to classify data into two mutually exclusive classes using a densely-connected neural network. In this exercise you will deal with a problem where you have more than two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you for classifying Reuters newswires into 46 different mutually-exclusive topics (multi-class classification problem), and since each data point should be classified into only one category, the problem is more specifically spoken a \"single-label, multi-class classification\" problem (compare lecture slide p.163). \n",
    "If each data point could have belonged to multiple categories (in our case the topics) then we would be facing a \"multi-label, multi-class classification\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example works with the so-called _Reuters dataset_, a set of short newswires and their topics, published by Reuters in 1986. It is a very simple, widely used toy data set for text classification. There are 46 different topics. Some topics are more represented than others, but each topic has got at least 10 examples in the training set. Like IMDB and MNIST, the Reuters data set comes packaged as part of Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=\"FFC300\">TASKS</font>:\n",
    "Within this notebook, the tasks that you need to work on are always listed as bullet points below. \n",
    "If a task is more challenging and consists of several steps, this is indicated as well. \n",
    "Make sure you have worked down the task list and commented your doings. \n",
    "This should be done using markdown.<br> \n",
    "<font color=red>Make sure you don't forget to specify your name and your matriculation number in the notebook before submitting it.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASKS in this exercise are as follows**:\n",
    "1. import the notebook to Google Colab.\n",
    "2. make sure you specified you name and your matriculation number in the header below my name and date.\n",
    "    * set the date too and remove mine.\n",
    "3. read the entire notebook carefully.\n",
    "    * add comments whereever you feel it necessary for better understanding\n",
    "    * run the notebook for the first time and note the result in your markdown result table (your test plan). \n",
    "4. decode the newswire back to english words by what you have learned from the previous exercise.\n",
    "5. go into the section 'building the ANN'. \n",
    "    * add the missing code that does create a network as shown in the image in the lecture slides on page 172 (File: 'DIS21a.1-7.HANDS_ON.First.DLNetwork.Architectures.for.Solving.Three.Interesting.Problems.pdf')\n",
    "    * set the activation function to ReLu\n",
    "    * set the correct activation function in the last layer/the output. What is correct when doing a single-label, multi-class classification?\n",
    "    * add the missing code for compiling the network by setting\n",
    "        * the loss function \n",
    "        * the optimizer\n",
    "        * an evaluation metric, that makes sense\n",
    "6. optimize the hyperparameters, build a new model and evaluate it on the test data. \n",
    "    * determine the minimum number of epochs and train a new model from scratch for this number of epochs.\n",
    "    * evaluate it on the test set from the data set you have loaded.\n",
    "7. make combinations of this according to your test plan. Make sure you combine with sense and reason and not just chaotically.\n",
    "    * Try using smaller or larger layers: 32 units, 128 units...\n",
    "    * We were using two hidden layers. Now try to use a single hidden layer, or three hidden layers.\n",
    "8. comment your observations.\n",
    "    * when is the accuracy increasing/decreasing? Describe your findings!"
