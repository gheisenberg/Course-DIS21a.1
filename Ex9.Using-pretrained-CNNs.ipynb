    "\n",
    "**GENERAL NOTE 2**: \n",
    "* Please, when commenting source code, just use English language only. \n",

    "### <font color=\"ce33ff\">DESCRIPTION</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows for reviewing two additional and essential techniques for applying deep learning to small data sets. These are: \n",
    "* doing feature extraction with a pre-trained network (this will get you to an accuracy of 90% up to 93%)\n",
    "* fine-tuning a pre-trained network (this will get you to a final accuracy of 95%). \n",
    "\n",
    "In combination, the three strategies you have learned, as (1) training a small model from scratch as in the previous exercise, (2) doing feature extracting using a pre-trained model, and (3) fine-tuning a pre-trained model will constitute your future toolbox for tackling the problem of performing computer vision with small data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the latter two are good options is that deep learning models are by nature highly reusable. It is possible to take an image classification model trained on a large-scale data set and then reuse it on a significantly different problem with only minor changes. \n",
    "Specifically, in the case of computer vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet data set) are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap (`https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping`) powerful vision models out of very little data. \n",

    "### Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-trained network is simply a saved network previously trained on a large data set, typically on a large-scale image classification task. If this original data set is large and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre-trained network can effectively act as a generic model of our visual world and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, one might train a network on ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then re-purpose this trained network for something as remote as identifying furniture items in images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning compared to many older shallow learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this exercise, a large CNN trained on the ImageNet data set is going to be used. ImageNet contains many animal classes, including different species of cats and dogs, and we can thus expect to perform very well on our cat vs. dog classification problem (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes: read more following <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet\">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the VGG16 architecture, developed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman in 2014, a simple and widely used CNN architecture for ImageNet (<a href=\"https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/\">https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/</a>). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is a bit of an older model, its architecture is similar to what you are already familiar with, and easy to understand without introducing any new concepts. You may also have heart other model names e.g. -- VGG, ResNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet, Xception... you will get used to them, as they will come up frequently if you keep doing deep learning for computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "So finally, let's get started with feature extraction."

    "### building a CNN by using a pre-trained CNN with feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction consists of using the representations learned by a previous network to extract interesting features from new samples. These features are then run through a new classifier, which is trained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw previously, CNNs used for image classification comprise two parts: they start with a series of pooling and convolution layers, and they end with a densely (fully) connected classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part is called the \"convolutional base\" of the model. In the case of CNNs, \"feature extraction\" will simply consist of taking the convolutional base of a previously-trained network, running the new data through it, and training a new classifier on top of the output (see pages 254-258 in slides `DIS21a.1-9.Convolutional.NeuralNetworks.pdf`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why only reuse the convolutional base? Could we reuse the densely-connected classifier as well? \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it should be avoided. The reason is simply that the representations learned by the convolutional base are likely to be more generic and therefore more reusable: the \n",
    "feature maps of a CNN are presence maps of generic concepts over a picture, which is likely to be useful regardless of the computer vision problem at hand. \n",
    "On the other end, the representations learned by the classifier will necessarily be very specific to the set of \n",
    "classes that the model was trained on -- they will only contain information about the presence probability of this or that class in the entire picture. \n",
    "Additionally, representations found in densely (fully) connected layers no longer contain any information about _where_ objects are located in the input image: these layers get rid of the notion of space, whereas the object location is still described by convolutional feature maps. For problems where object location matters, densely (fully) connected features would be largely useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the level of generality (and therefore reusability) of the representations extracted by specific convolution layers depends on the depth of the layer in the model. Layers that come earlier in the model, extract local, highly generic feature maps (such as visual edges, colors, and textures), while layers higher-up extract more abstract concepts (such as \"cat ear\" or \"dog eye\"). So if your new data set differs a lot from the data set that the original model was trained on, you may be better off using only the first few layers of the model to do feature extraction, rather than using the entire convolutional base (compare the two images at the top of this exercise notebook that I provided you with).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since the ImageNet class set did contain multiple dog and cat classes, it is likely that it would be beneficial to reuse the information contained in the densely (fully) connected layers of the original model. However, we will choose not to, in order to cover the more general case where the class set of the new problem does not overlap with the class set of the original model."
